# Adaboost_Terrrain_Classification
The goal is to do terrain classification with an algorithm of your choice, researching and deploying it on your own.

Adaboost is a Ensemble Classifier. Ensemble classifier are made up of multiple classifier algorithms and whose output is combined result of output of those classifier algorithms

It retrains the algorithm iteratively by choosing the training set based on accuracy of previous training.
The weight-age of each trained classifier at any iteration depends on the accuracy achieved.
